Description
===========

PyUnwrap is a very efficient phase unwrapper with a nice python/mayavi2
interface.

This code adopts 2D and 3D phase-field unwrapping routines originally
written by Munther Gdeisat and adapted to Python as part of the Recon
Tools project from the Brain Imaging Center at University of
California, Berkeley.
